Inofficial plugin to display data from the official result service `SAMS` 
by the german volleyball confederation DVV (Deutscher Volleyballverband).

== Description ==

Never update rankings or fixtures lists by hand again!

The `SAMS Integration` will integrate the actual ranking or fixtures into your WordPress website.

To use this plugin you need to get an API key. Usually you can get this easily from your regional 
confederation. I got mine from the WVV (Westdeutscher Volleyballverband).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/sams-integration` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I obtain an API Key? =

If you or your club is a member of a regional confederation you can get this API key easily from them.
